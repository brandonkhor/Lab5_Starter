### Check your understanding
1. To verify that the message feature is functioning correctly, we need to ensure that the message is sent by the user, the DOM layout updates appropriately (e.g., a message bubble appears), and the recipient receives and sees the message as intended. These checks require the interaction of multiple components across the application, which requires end-to-end testing. Since unit tests are limited to testing isolated parts of code without evaluating how they work together, they are not suitable for validating the full functionality of the message feature.
2. Unit testing is suitable for this use case because we are testing a small, isolated part of the application â€” the logic that enforces a maximum message length of 80 characters. This feature does not depend on other components or user interactions across the system, making it ideal for unit tests.
